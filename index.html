        <h2>Animations are a great way to waste time</h2>
        <p>
          There are many ways to use D3 in terms of displaying massive amounts of important data in a visually appeasing and understandable way.
        </p>

        <p>
          The ways objects are animated in D3 is similar to how it is done in video games. At the core of this beautiful framework we find advanced ways of rendering things such as lighting, object animation and effects relative to user interaction.
        </p>

        <p>
          Having this type of ability within web development is quite remarkable and should be fully utilized whenever possible, however, it can also be used just to make a site more dynamic and less boring.

        <h2>Earlier Projects</h2>

        <p>
          My previous explorations of D3 projects were more related to displaying large chunks of data in a way companies could easily consume.
        </p>

        <h2>Where D3 Really Shines</h2>

        <p>
          Although there are many great usecases for D3, there is one in particular that makes more sense than the others - dashboards which visually keep track of alot of important data.

        <p>
          I'll probably come back and add a few examples of the aforementioned usecase later on.
